### Current Website Issues

#### Design:

The clients current site is not appropriate due to its outdated design. The sites code uses too much java script and too much divs. The overall layout of the site could be better designed as well.

#### Speed:

Slow loading times, poor mobile responsiveness hinder user experience and accessibility.

#### Accessibility

The site needs attention to detail in its design to accomodate those with accessibility issues, particularly the contrast, and font colours.

#### Content:

The services content will be moved to the homepage as it is the content the customer will be looking for, there is a short video on the home page which will be moved to the gallery page. The content will be broken up into blocks, each with their own related heading to help the user understand the content. The javascript with the moving hero images will be reeplaced with either a back ground colour or a static image. (If the page does not load for the user, a default colour representing the clients brand colours will be in place)

**HomePage**
The main content explaining the clients over all mission and history will be left in tact, but possibly simplified, as to present more easily understood and readable content. The goal of that approach is to ensure the potential customers read the content and understand the message, the user should not feel overwhelmed and avoid reading the clients main message.

**Services**

**Asphalt Driveways**: This section will resemble the original websites content as there is not many issues with the actual content, it will include a header, and an image.
**Gravel Driveways**: This section will resemble the original content but build into a block with a header and a related image.
**Small Parkinglots**: This section will follow the same content structure as the other services.

#### Redesign Approach

#### Visual Mood

The specific moods the site should convey is a clean and professional look, a well maintained website, The website should be fast to load, and strategically structured, for easy navigation, and use of the page.

#### Inspiration

1.[https://islandpaving.com/] This site serves as an inspiration because it is a larger business in the same industry which is well established and accomplished, that being said there is some of the same issues with their website which will not be adopted. I do however like the simplicity of their home page, and as a larger company they offer more services which if all confined to the home page would crowd the home page, and alter the user experience. I do like the fixed navigation bar, I think it would be a good edition to the home page.

2.[https://www.ecowestprojects.ca/] I found this website to have everything I need on the homepage, the page has a clean professional feel and look to it. The home page provides a call to action that is very easily understood, which I feel is very inviting for the potential customers. I feel like the stationary side nav bar is a good look, it feels more modern, every section of this site is very easily understood, and it is likely I will use a design much like this for the project.

#### Colours

**Primary**: The colours of this website will consist of 30% grey 30% White 30% Black 10% Red, this will maintain the brand that the community has known and trusted for many years.
**Secondary**: The font colours may differ, between white or black in colour depanding on the contrast and positioning/ background.

#### Fonts

**Primary Font**: The chosen font typeface will be Archivo, it is a recomended font from a professional website developer.
**Font Size**: The font will be a minimum size of 16px.
